# cBioPortal.ca

cBioPortal is an interactive exploratory analysis resource for cancer genomics data sets that host data from various individual labs and consortiums. The tool links genomic and clinical data from cancer patients across the world. The platform allows for data sharing among clinicians, physicians, and researchers to access and collaborate. At this time, there is no support for non-coding variants, as they would be filtered out and not shown on the portal. cBioPortal.ca is Princess Margaret Cancer Centreâ€™s instance of cBioPortal.org. It is different from the general cBioPortal.org whereby the data is access controlled to the project-level. cBioPortal is supported by The Terry Fox Foundation, The Princess Margaret Data Science of The Princess Margaret Cancer Foundation, and The BC Cancer Foundation. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to contact the Pugh lab and UHN Research Helpdesk.

All information in this documentation refers back to the official cBioportal.org's documentation. This documentation is to simply further help users understand how to organize their data into the appropriate files and formats. This is to also help our users apply some standardization to the project naming scheme and clinical data files.&#x20;
