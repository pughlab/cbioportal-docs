# Clinical Data: cBioPortal + MOHCCN

The standardization of clinical data is the goal of the MOHCCN clinical fields file. It incorporates data dictionaries from both ICGC ARGO and ASCO mCODE. To import clinical data in the MOHCCN format into cBioPortal, there must be a fusion of cBioPortal's required fields as well. This section splits up the MOHCCN required fields into separate files that also incorporates the cBioPortal required fields. &#x20;

\*Will look into whether or not the MOHCCN excel is available for public view\*
