# Clinical Data: cBioPortal + MOHCCN

The standardization of clinical data is the goal of the MOHCCN clinical fields file. It incorporates data dictionaries from both the International Cancer Genome Consortium Accelerating Research in Genomic Oncology ([ICGC ARGO](https://www.icgc-argo.org)) and American Society of Clinical Oncology Minimal Common Data Elements ([ASCO mCODE](https://www.asco.org/news-initiatives/current-initiatives/cancer-care-initiatives/mcode-standard-data-ehr)). To import clinical data in the MOHCCN format into cBioPortal, there must be a fusion of cBioPortal's required fields as well. This section splits up the MOHCCN required fields into separate files that also incorporates the cBioPortal required fields. &#x20;
